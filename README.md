# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

> A real-time fraud detection solution powered by XGBoost to identify and prevent fraudulent financial transactions.

## The Problem

Financial fraud is a significant and growing problem, causing billions of dollars in losses each year. Traditional rule-based systems are often too slow and inflexible to keep up with the evolving tactics of fraudsters. This results in financial losses, damage to customer trust, and a poor user experience.

## Our Solution

We have developed a machine learning-powered solution that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. Our model, built with XGBoost, analyzes transaction patterns to identify suspicious activity with high precision and recall.

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, all within a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and iteration.

## Live Demo & Visuals

While we don't have a live demo deployed at the moment, you can see the model's performance and visualizations of the results in the `notebooks/detect_fraud_xgboost.ipynb` notebook. These include:

*   **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the model's accuracy in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
*   **ROC Curve**: To show the model's ability to separate the two classes.
*   **Feature Importance**: To understand which transaction features are the most predictive of fraud.

## Tech Stack

*   **Core Model**: Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn
*   **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
*   **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd fraud-detection
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv detect-fraud-env
    source detect-fraud-env/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
    # detect-fraud-env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook and run the model:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then, open `notebooks/detect_fraud_xgboost.ipynb` and run all the cells.

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the main challenges was dealing with the highly imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions are very rare. We addressed this by using the `scale_pos_weight` parameter in XGBoost to give more weight to the minority class, which significantly improved the model's ability to detect fraud.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

*   **High Recall**: Our model achieved a recall of over 99% on the test set, meaning it can catch almost all fraudulent transactions.
*   **End-to-End Pipeline**: We built a complete end-to-end pipeline in a single Jupyter Notebook, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and saving.
*   **Interpretability**: We included feature importance analysis to understand the key drivers of fraud, making the model's decisions more interpretable.

## What's Next

*   **Real-time API**: Deploy the model as a REST API using a framework like FastAPI or Flask for real-time fraud detection.
*   **Modular Codebase**: Refactor the code from the Jupyter Notebook into a more modular and maintainable Python package.
*   **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Explore more complex features to further improve the model's performance.
*   **Unit Tests**: Add a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
